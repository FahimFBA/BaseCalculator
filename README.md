## Backstory

I made this project for my Advanced Object Oriented Programming Lab at United International University. It was our first quiz day, and our faculty asked us to make this project. I managed to build the entire project from scratch within 16 minutes. But I have also created a long step by step tutorial video to show others how you can also make this type projects from scratch!

## Feature

1. Decimal to Binary
2. Decimal to Hexadecimal
3. Decimal to Octal
4. Next Screen button to go into additional pages
5. Clear the User Panel
6. Exit the program

## Main class
The main class is **MainLanding** class that is located within `src/main/java/com/calculator/basecalculator/MainLanding.java`.

## Contribution

Any kind of useful contribution is more than welcome! ðŸ¤—

## Usage

You can use this project, but make sure to **fork** it instead of cloning and pushing it to your repository.
